# Seven Years - A Seven Days to Die Overhaul

Set seven years after the world fell apart and the dead started trying to eat us. The living have started to take back the world again. You have been flown to an area that hasn't been visited in a long while in search of more supplies for the coming winter months. You home colony has finally reached 1000 strong but with this, the demands have grown. 

As a field operative, your job is to go out and find resources to send home. This is what you were doing when your helicopter had a mechanical failure and crash landed. Can you gather the supplies needed to keep home alive while keeping yourself alive too? What new threats will you have to deal with?
