# Seven Years - A Seven Days to Die Overhaul

Set seven years after the world fell apart and the dead started trying to eat us. The living have started to take back the world again. You have been flown to an area that hasn't been visited in a long while in search of more supplies for the coming winter months. You home colony has finally reached 1000 strong but with this, the demands have grown. 

As a field operative, your job is to go out and find resources to send home. This is what you were doing when your helicopter had a mechanical failure and crash landed. Can you gather the supplies needed to keep home alive while keeping yourself alive too? What new threats will you have to deal with?

This Overhaul is still in beta and not complete. Feedback is needed and appriciated. 

# Compatibility

Latest version is working with Alpha 20.4
Untested for multiplayer so far 

# Installation

Drop all of the modlets contained in this overhaul into your mods folder. That should be it. Nothing special.

This overhaul was written without any other mods or molets installed. Currently, it is meant to be stand alone with no other mods installed. I will add a compatability list for popular mods that will work with this overhaul.
